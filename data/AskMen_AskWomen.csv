How do you know when you're well enough to get into a relationship again?,4,hwm0jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/hwm0jj/how_do_you_know_when_youre_well_enough_to_get/,2,1595560538.0,"TLDR; I was a fat loser in his 20's that lost a ton of weight and got a great well paying job, now I want to date but I have also been addressing a lot of issues by going to therapy as an adult for the first time in my life, and I have begun to realize that my issues with depression and self-esteem will not go away if I'm in a relationship and will probably just lead to a toxic relationship. How do I know, if I even can, when I am ready to date again?

For some context: Before this pandemic started I was obese, drinking a lot, smoking, and doing drugs rather regularly. I was working a minimum wage job I hated, but I had passed a board exam for a position I really wanted and was gambling on it. I had not had a girlfriend in over 2 years because my last relationship was extremely abusive and toxic, and other than the random hookup that would rarely occur I was supplementing my need for sex with hookers and cocaine.

Now when this pandemic became a thing and we began to be quarantined I managed to get that awesome job, and my chances of fucking hookers and doing blow decreased exponentially, plus I got a crush and wanted to be better. After realizing that I did have game but was just very unattractive and had not really tried for years, I made the decision that I needed to improve so I could date this specific girl, this was very stupid as I had already wedged a large divide between us due to some really stupid things I did trying to be romantic even after she rebuffed me.

Fast forward to today I have lost a ton of weight and gained muscle, I actually look attractive naked again like I did in high school. I'm also making more money, and not doing drugs nor hookers anymore. I have objectively improved myself in every aspect physically, but then a couple of weeks ago I made the decision to address my anger problems and depression, so I began to seek therapy. I have been completely honest with my therapist and she has been extremely helpful in me reaching actualization and introspection. I have a lot more appreciation about myself and realize that the true value of self-improvement was to myself, not some lady.

The big issue that is occurring is that a lot of my really bad behaviors and thought patterns are being brought up, and a history of abuse and phobias in my childhood are being analyzed. Now I am seeing how not only those things have hurt my life, but specifically my romantic and sexual relationships with women. I for some reason have this massive insecurity about dating that really makes no sense, as I have had hot girlfriends and have only been rejected like 3 times in my whole life. Yet I go years in these depressive episodes where I don't try at all in my relationships and even make really impulsive sexual decisions.

I want to date again, and there are several candidates I can begin to court, but I really feel like damaged goods that will make a relationship shitty and have not started to do anything. How do I get past this? Am I correct in assuming that and should just wait till I'm better?",0

I (M31) am 300+lbs and trying to lose weight via home workouts while quarantining. I lost around 95 lbs between 2013 and 2016.

But I found someone new in 2016, cut back on smoking (and finally kicked the habit - yay!), but still was gaining weight. I am now back to the weight I was in 2012. A lot of this has to do with moving back to a job and place where I am sedentary.

I (26M) am conflicted as to whether or not continue pursuing a girl (24F)

I was in a 3 year committed relationship that ended almost two years ago, I’ve been living the single life since and am over casual hookups. From that relationship, I learned exactly what it is I want in a partner.

About a year and a half ago (a few months after my breakup), I met a girl with whom I share a connection I’d never experienced with anyone else. She is into many of the same hobbies I’m into and also speaks my first language (somewhat of a rarity where I live).

At the time, she was in a LTR. I met her, sparks flew, but I didn’t expect anything to come of it as she was committed to another man. I saw her at a few parties and we would always gravitate towards one another and spend most of the night talking before she would inevitably end up with her bf.

She disappeared for 6 months (she told me recently that she had a crush on me at the time and felt it inappropriate to keep in touch), until I threw a party in April 2019 and invited our mutual friend group including her and her bf. 

She showed up, he didn’t. We went for multiple walks outside throughout the night and I sent her on her way, never crossing physical boundaries out of respect for her relationship. 

For the next few parties, she starts talking to me about her relationship problems and how she thinks it’s on the verge of ending and we kept talking throughout the spring until last summer where she came to a party with her bf and things seem to be going well for them again.

At that point, I decided enough is enough, I have been interfering with the relationship for too long, I moved on and forgot about her. 

Until covid.

She reached out and told me she’d broken up with her bf over winter and wanted to discuss everything that went down between us the previous year. 

We spent hours talking on the phone about her side of things and mine because we hadn’t admitted our feelings to one another up until that point. We started making plans to hangout once covid calmed down and I was back in town.

I’ve been back home, at work for almost a month and have been reaching out to take her out. She has been taking online courses and saying she’s too swamped to hangout as she has a lot of exams to study for.

About two weeks ago, she stopped responding to my messages and texts and I found out from our mutual friend that she is seeing another guy.

I am hurt by the lack of acknowledgement and communication but understand that she doesn’t owe me anything as we had never officially started seeing each other. 

Yesterday, out of the blue, she reached out again. At this point I am unsure whether to keep pursuing the relationship as I have never connected with someone on the same level as I did with her.

I’m here looking for outside perspective. Maybe someone has been in a similar situation and it worked out for them after persisting or maybe I’m blinded by the rose coloured glasses I have on for this girl. 

Should I tell her I know about the new guy and express how she hurt me or just forget about her and move on?

TLDR; met a girl who had a bf last year and fell for her over the course of 8 months, accepted it wouldn’t happen and moved on. Got a message from her a year later saying she likes me and would like to hang out. Then found out she started seeing another guy. What do?",0

I would love to buy him a comfortable and highly supportive chair but these prices are CRAZY! $1,000+ for a chair? I know the spiel of “that price is nothing for the price of your back” but I’m sure there has got to be some sort of budget-friendly dupe out there. I already read about the Herman Miller used chairs but he’s a big germaphobe so I prefer to buy a new chair that falls within my budget.

I’m looking for $250 and under (hopefully on the under side, as I am also trying to buy a bunch of other items for him too).

What is emotional abuse?,3,hwgcox,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/hwgcox/what_is_emotional_abuse/,5,1595542382.0,"I have had a very tough relationship in the past, and I have tried to reach out to reconcile (let's call her X).Emotionally, we are in different places, where I am trying to give her understanding, by talking to her about everything that makes her happy, and unhappy. I am trying to keep in mind all the things that remediate her feeling like shit, about my actions. She does not feel like I'm giving her everything, and she is right. I told her I am afraid she will use me as she has before in the past. 

I am afraid she will overwhelm me and pull me into the previous cycles of pain. Cycles where I get dragged into repetitions of reactions, one crowning on top of another until it festers for years. I am afraid of that because it has happened so many times.I tried talking about my fear. Her first response was ""you hurt me too, I even had to go to narcissist survivor group, but I don't talk about that"". I think that was a very toxic way to be, and that is not okay with me. It shows that she is interested in talking only about her hurt, and is not actually there to understand me or my fears. 

A person who is genuinely interested in understanding someone else puts aside their own feelings and ideologies to try and empathise with the person experiencing it. There will be times when the person is not capable of such understanding, but it is the openness of trying, is what creates a safe space. It was not done, in fact, an unsafe space was being created because of my fear was being minimised by her talking about a competing fear. An unsafe space was created by her refusal to accept me when I am being vulnerable while talking about these issues.This used to be the start of many, many cycles we had experienced in the past, and it was beginning again.

 I told her that i have not seen her change from her past because she is displaying the same patterns. She took that as me attacking her, and i tried to explain myself by comparing that what i had feared to what was happening. This was the main reason why i have kept a lot of my emotions at bay and was not able to be as open as I wanted to be.Manipulation of my words, talking over me, not being able to keep sight of my efforts and facts, and using feelings to dominate the truth, have been used today to undercut what i have actually been doing, and its made me question my self worth, my reality and also my own motivations. 

At some level, I am beginning to think that she wants me to lose myself in my emotions so that I am easier to control. Easier to manipulate. ""A healthy relationship is based on trust, understanding, and mutual respect."" I think that in this case, understanding is not being actively being reached for by X and that I am doing the heavy lifting because I am trying to understand her, I'm trying to build that trust by understanding her more, and giving her mutual respect by actively listening and putting into practice things that will make a difference.

My talk about my fears was pushed aside, and focus was put on ""me not seeing a change from her past"" then that was used to overwhelm and change the tone of the conversation. it was at this point i felt like i was being spoken to very rudely, not being heard and that it was very unsafe for me to be there, and so i left that situation. this was followed by a lot of text messages around how i was wrong, how i have crossed her boundaries, how i have devalued her, and how disappointed she is in my behaviour. and how she wants to instead for us to work together.

Emotional manipulation comes in many forms, and i am starting to wonder if this is maybe that. I need to take time to understand if this is emotional manipulation, and what to do about it if it is. and also make sure that i am doing right by X as well.

Can you help me understand if this is? What should I look for going forward? Is it okay for me to set that emotional distance before I give myself fully? Is okay to have those boundaries in place?

Still, I feel like I'm lagging behind, that I'm sabotaging my chances of financial independence by not working while studying, and that I don't really know how I'm going to establish financial independence in myself. The only thing I know that can be an income is the job after college itself, as I don't think I possess enough knowledge or money to attempt investing into company shares that pay dividends (nor any stocks in general), nor do I have a solid idea of a product or commodity to produce for a side-company (I had considered microgreens, gourmet mushrooms, and a possible idea for a piece of martial arts training equipment, but I'm not exactly confident they'll flourish). Obviously where I'm at, real estate is far down the line, and even five to ten years from now, I probably wouldn't be in the position to take out a loan, which I've been taught is a bad practice.

Why do I find it easier to meet and sleep with women than to form platonic friendships with other men?,6,hw6vfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/hw6vfm/why_do_i_find_it_easier_to_meet_and_sleep_with/,41,1595497418.0,"Title may sound a bit ridiculous, let me explain.

I (28m) put a lot of work into learning how to express myself and my desires around women. I’m ok with being rejected and don’t take it personally.

As a result, I find a lot of women who are interested in me. I enjoy talking about the way I feel about things, and listening to what is going on in life. I form emotional connections pretty easily with them, even if it is just for one night. I’ve been with more women than any other man I know.

But when I try and use to have similar kinds of conversations where I’m trying to get to know someone platonically, it doesn’t seem to work as well. This is particularly true when I try to form friendships with other men. I’m unsure if this is because it’s just to intense for them, or there just not used to another man wanting to talk deeply.

I have three close guy friends and they’re all pretty good with talking about their emotions. One is a psychologist, one is a computer programmer and the other is an artist. The first two guys I became close with because we all studied philosophy and have a lot of overlapping interest (one was in the same course as me, the other I met by chance at a gig). They don’t know each other though. 

The third has been a friend since I was a child. We have less in common, but he’s effectively my brother. Whenever we talk it’s about the good old days, films we’re enjoying, what our families are up too - things like that. Also music and comedy. 

I’m really good at the deep and meaningful part of friendship. But I don’t seem to be very good at forming friendships.

To be clear, I feel extremely lucky to have three close male friends. I know that this is more than a lot of guys have.

But I feel lonely a lot of the time. I don’t get to see my friends often. Particularly not with Covid on - the two philosophy buddies are a good forty minutes away from me, and the childhood friend lives three hours away by plane. 

I’m not sure if that it’s I expect to much depth, that I try to pidgeon hole people into a deeper friendship than they’re ready for or that I just get bored talking about surface level shit.

With dating, being open and real about who I am is what creates the connections. I’m a self aware, highly educated and informed man who is comfortable talking about my faults. This is, as I’ve discovered, an attractive quality to women.

Dudes aren’t always as into these kind of chats. And it’s not that I don’t have “masculine” interests. I enjoy watching  rugby and MMA. I powerlift, practice BJJ and I run. I used to work for a major car brand. But I rarely come across other guys who are into talking about what interests Side note, I’m also a larger man at 115kg, so for you fat lads out there, don’t think women won’t be into you because you’re a fat lad. Some girls love it. them, and I don’t get why. 

So often I want to talk about films and how they made me feel with other dudes, but I don’t get a chance too. Or about comedy, breaking down a joke. Listening to one of my mates gush about how his smoker is working perfectly makes me really happy. 

It could also be that my own life is just boring to a lot of people I interact with. Not much to change there really. I like my life and find it interesting.

I just I had more friends who I could go see artsy films with, go out for meals with. I want to make more friends who are closer to me geographically. 

I don’t know if I’m asking a question here so much as sharing a thought. I’d like to know how to form friendships that matter to me. I’d like to have more guys want to be my friend.

TLDR: I like talking about what matters to me. This goes down well with women, but not as often with other men. I’d like to form more male friendships, but I’m not sure how",0

I was recently informed by my girlfriend that our vacation time is going to be spend redoing our upstairs bathroom. Its a 9' x 9'
room, with no bath or shower. Just the toilet and a sink.

We have a budget to redo a room each year. This year, she decided we are doing the bathroom. I'm less than thrilled about it as i didnt mind our bathroom, but she hate it. We will install new flooring, install some shelves, add some furniture and repaint it.

As it turn out, I was able to find a massive deal on our flooring. A coworker of mine just redid his bathroom with the same kind of flooring she wants and he bought way too much, so he is selling it to me for next to nothing. 

Because of that, our budget is way more flexible than anticipated. I'm thinking of getting tons of cool stuff or gadget for the bathroom with the leftover budget. Saving that money for next year room will only make my girlfriend buy more expensive things, so i prefer spending that money on useful stuff instead of cosmetic stuff

My first thought was a smart mirror. The kind that connect to the internet and give you the weather and the news. But those thing cost WAY too much.

So far my gadget list is:

1. Bidet (it was on the list before i found we had leftover money)

2. Motion activated toilet light


Thats it... Turns out, bathroom gadget are not very common

So how do i spend an extra 150-200$ in my bathroom with useful items?",0

How do guys feel about dating a girl who grew up in an abnormal/poor household?,42,hw3qe4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/hw3qe4/how_do_guys_feel_about_dating_a_girl_who_grew_up/,63,1595485996.0,"Basically, I'm casually dating this guy and I really like him and where things are going. I assume if things keep going as well as they have been, he'll want to make it official. My only concern is that my family background is pretty abnormal, and I'm dreading him--or really anyone I date--meeting my family. I grew up in poverty and while I've been pretty financially independent since I was 18 (I'm 22 now and just graduated from a good university), I still have to come home to my mom's very tiny apartment to visit every now and then and I'm kind of embarrassed by it. My mom is widowed and lives alone. She and I usually get along, but she's kind of awkward when she meets my friends (i.e. doesn't know how to make conversation and whatnot) and I feel like she might end up being like that with significant others, as well. Also, the apartment is just really cluttered and messy, but my mom refuses to move things around to make it more inviting so I can't even imagine ever bringing a guy home to her.

Do guys care if a girl's family is poor or kinda broken, even if the girl is financially comfortable and pretty well-adjusted herself? I just feel like you can't choose family and I don't want something out of my control to wreck my dating life.",0

Neither of us are very happy with our program and it has honestly been very difficult to be productive during quarantine. I have been able to deal with it a little better than him only because my PI checks up on my group so often that it sort of forces me to. He, however, has not been able to get out of bed some days or motivate himself to do work others or sometimes he'll just go golfing to get himself out of a rut for a few hours. He'll have days that he gets a lot done and it's enough to present to his PI, but overall has been really lacking in motivation and overall happiness. I have struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life and I see a lot of the signs in him right now (i.e. sleeping too much, little interest in things he used to love, small appetite, etc.). I was medicated for it since I was 18, but because I moved states for grad school I stopped going to my normal psychiatrist and I have been off my antidepressant since about April (at that time it was over a year since I had seen my doctor and ran out of refills on the perscription). I have found myself in a similar rut to him recently (little motivation to get work done, feeling really down on myself, not wanting to get out of bed).

We've just been sort of dealing with it on our own even though I think we could both tell something was wrong with the other. The kicker happened today when at about 12pm I decided to go check on him to see if he was up and wanted to eat or anything. We've been staying with his mom for the last few months since quarantine happened so she's been noticing this pattern in him as well. When I went to see if he was okay he broke down in tears just crying on my shoulder (he NEVER cries), I tried to comfort him and ask what was wrong but I just found myself sobbing next to him (it was really hard to see him cry). He couldn't really talk but he handed me his phone and then went to take a shower. When I looked at his phone, his mom had sent him a really long email about how she doesn't think he's working hard enough in school and needs to grow up and realize he has a really good opportunity at the school we're at. She also mentioned that she is struggling financially and needs to know that he's going to be able to support himself after this year (I think she pays for his phone and car still). I know she meant well but it's also hard for people who aren't struggling with depression to understand what it's like for someone to go through with it. I think he might need professional help as well. Anyways, the email just made me cry even harder. I wanted to be able to support him and help him feel better but him seeing me cry only made him feel worse. I really want to know what I can do to help him, but I'm also struggling so much myself. If anyone has gone through something similar, please let me know. We get along really well and despite our struggles, our relationship is still good. I just want to know what I can do to support him. Sorry that was so long!

TLDR: I think my boyfriend is struggling with depression, his mom sent him an intensely worded email about his research performance this summer. I broke down crying when he was sad and feel like I wasn't there for him in a way that was helpful. Seeking advice on how to support him now and in the future.

Edit: Thanks for all of your responses and suggestions! Yesterday after reading one of the first comments, I decided it was time for me to get back on my meds. I called my doctor from my home state and he filled my perscription for 3 months but told me I needed to look for someone permanent in my area. I started looking for doctors that were in network after that. Last night, I talked to my boyfriend about him seeing a doctor. He agreed that it would be helpful to see someone professionally to get therapy or medication or a combination depending on what they suggest. He was thankful for the suggestion and after looking for doctors for a bit I think we found someone we're both going to see in our area. We also talked about starting to run again (something we used to do everyday but stopped since our marathon got cancelled due to covid). I think exercise will help too as many of you suggested. Okay last thing, we realized that grad school is the thing that is toxic in our lives, we both have enough credits to get our master's in January so we are both going to do that instead of our PhDs. Maybe that's giving up, idk, but it's causing us to be unhappy so we're stopping. Then we watched a movie and had a nice evening together. Thanks again for all the suggestions! They were so helpful!

My therapist recommend I join a group session, which I did, and out of the nine people there I am the ONLY guy. That in itself is kind of upsetting because, in my experience, eating disorders was always kind of presented as a female thing. I felt even more alone for having a ""female problem"" and going to that group only seemed to confirm it. Now I know that isn't actually true and there are plenty of males with similar problems, but still. You can't deny that not only does the problem SEEM more prevalent in women, but it also SEEMS far more accepted and supported with women than it does with men.

To make matters worse, I have a tendency to tear up when talking about something that makes me really uncomfortable. Not like cry, but glassy eyed with an occasional tear I guess. Most times I don't even feel upset, it feels like an involuntary self defense thing more than anything else. For some that may seem like a totally normal thing, but growing up in a household where you were constantly told that it makes you appear weak really changes your perception on stuff like that lol.

So my session consisted of me, a 23 year old man, in a room surrounded by women talking about a very uncomfortable part of my life that the public perceives as a more ""feminine"" issue, and then tearing up as I'm talking. I had never felt that small and exposed in my entire life.

Of course everyone was very supportive but it still felt very very wrong, like I should be ashamed.

We have worked through many of these issues together but the one thing that has consistently caused issues are that my insecurities make me want to be perfect and plan perfect dates with her. This inevitably cannot  occur because  nothing in life is perfect yet I cannot seem to look past the flaws or my failings and I let that affect me which causes me to feel depressed.


The other big thing I do which causes problems in our relationships is that I am terrible for believing in my assumptions which also affects my mood. 
How would I be able to look past hiccups in my plans? How could I deal with these assumptions?
Or is there any other piece of advice you all could give me that might help?

How do you deal with finding alone productive time when you have to take care of younger siblings?,7,hvhra6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/hvhra6/how_do_you_deal_with_finding_alone_productive/,7,1595400441.0,"So those past few days have been going pretty roughly for me. I(18) am about to start university and there are 2 entrance exams I need to take at the end of August and September. Studying during these months, especially those last few weeks, was pretty challenging, since I have to take care of my younger (now) 2 year-old half-sister. 

Taking care of my half-sister takes me about 4-5 hours per day, some days even more, which literally drains my energy levels.

I have to take care of her each and every day and have to do many things my pregnant stepmom requires me to do (buy groceries, take the trash out, go out again with my sister). But she doesn't really consider the fact that my whole future is dependent on those 2 exams (for context I'm about to study medicine) and is worried too little about me, even if I tell her.

Some days I started waking up at 5:00 AM and made a bit of progress. But still, my sister wakes up at 9-10 AM and only takes a nap from 2-4 PM. Practically when she wakes up at 9 AM she is always going to come to my room and want to play/watch a YouTube video or something else. Then I have to play with her until she eats breakfast and sometimes after her breakfast. After her nap she will want to play outside and I have to be around her. 

I tried going to the library, but on the last two weeks COVID cases in my country (Kosova) are going up drastically and I don't like to risk going out.

How long is the whole processes of sex for you? What generally is the structure of it?,6,hvelza,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/hvelza/how_long_is_the_whole_processes_of_sex_for_you/,15,1595390413.0,"A common structure without any *kinks* for me and my girlfriend looks like this. Whenever me and my girl get it on, the total experience is usually 1-2.5 hours. We ususally start with kissing and heavy petting for a little. We then usually switch to oral. She'll give me some for like 10 min and I'll give her for 20-40 min since its the only way she'll come. We usually bang it out for like 3-20 min depending how long I'm able to last/ how long ago my last nut was. I might give her round 2 of oral for a bit if she's up for it/did not come earlier. Then we cuddle in afterglow. 


Although we really enjoy sex and the intimacy of it all, the process feels really long. If we are speedrunning sex we could probably do it in 20 min but she would not be warmed up well, she would not get a chance to come, and we would not get to cuddle which is probably the most important part for her. A lot of times, even when we are both horny, we won't have sex because of how long it takes. We'll be moving in together soon so hopefully we can get better at faster sex...

Recently I came across an ad on FB (I know... bad start...). It was advertising these really stylish trench coats for men; they were made of wool and were hooded, and I thought they looked really great because they could go with either casual wear or formal wear.

Being a broke millennial who can only treat themselves once in a while, I saved up for it. Except this morning, when I logged in to order myself one, it tried to redirect me to a different site, which made me hesitate. After a quick search, I discovered that many people had been scammed by the company, either getting gaslighted or ghosted by them.

This may sound like a common occurrence. Except that my fiancé always seems to order from these online sites and gets her clothes within a WEEK.

Does someone know of a good, trustworthy site for men’s clothing? As I mentioned before, I am a struggling millennial, hence why it isn’t so easy for me to just go to the mall and buy a nice coat, as most of them are out of my price range. I’d say $100-120 is my price limit for a coat. Casual/formal wear is what I’m going for, something versatile.

The chat went well and she agreed we should do it again soon. I asked her if she wanted to do something this week and she comes back with ""Hey!

What can trigger long term attraction ?,6,hv4rjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/hv4rjw/what_can_trigger_long_term_attraction/,8,1595354679.0," 

Hi Everyone

I'm currently 22 years old, I've had one long term relation that lasted 2 years. Everything else couldn't really be called a relationship as it was more for having fun than really looking for long term. Now I've been dating women for the last 12 months, over dating sites or just by meeting girls at parties or events.

In those past 12 months I met a couple women, some which I dated for a couple of weeks, the longest ""relation"" lasted maybe 2 months. My problem is that despite being physically attractive, none of these girls gave me any feelings of ""falling in love"".  
I don't know if I ever really fell in love up to this date, so I can't really tell how it should feel.

All I know is when I spend more then a month with any of those women I met, I'm already tired of them or not really interested anymore. When I look at some of my friends, that have relationships lasting for 5-6 years, that live together and technically share the same life together.

Is it maybe me, am I just not made for long term relations or I just haven't met my ""soulmate"" yet. I really wish I could find that one girl where it just ""clicks"", but up to today I couldn't find that in any girl.

If it's not physical attraction, what could trigger feelings in the first place?",0

Not officially in a relationship, but everything is great and going well.

I have endured a fair amount of trauma in my childhood and life. In the first month-two months of dating, I am insecure and obsessive, but once the other person shows that they are trustworthy etc, I go back to my ""normal"" self, which is somewhat distant and very independent in relationships. Luckily for me, we're past the first stage and I don't feel insecure at all.

I really like the person I'm seeing and he's definitely a catch. In my life, I've never felt overly attached to anyone and never felt like I needed anyone, unlike a lot of my friends in relationships. I'm not sure what being in love feels like. I have a laundry list of reasons why I like him, why he's better than the rest. I'm very **affectionate, supportive, verbally appreciative, sexually engaged, reliable, communicative** and he has expressed directly that he's happy but I'm worried that my sometimes feeling of emotional numbness or vacancy might not be good enough for someone else.

What else do men need besides what is in bold? I want to give enough to keep this person but I obviously can't give beyond my capabilities. Has anyone been in a relationship with someone that lacked an emotional connection? What is an emotional connection?

How can I help get my boyfriend to brush his teeth?,0,hurhah,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/hurhah/how_can_i_help_get_my_boyfriend_to_brush_his_teeth/,54,1595300910.0,"EDIT: Think I got some great advice, thanks for everyone who commented! I'll keep reading comments if you have other advice to help, but I just won't be actively responding for a bit.
   
We live alone together, he's 24 years old and has a problem of not brushing his teeth. He wasn't like this when we first started dating six years ago, he wouldn't brush his teeth every day but he would do it at least like 4 or 5 times a week. And his smile was just to die for when we first met. Not brushing at all has become a consistent thing for the past 2 years. His teeth are starting to become yellow and I'm afraid that with his nightly sweet snacks he eats, he has a few cavities as well. This, sadly, makes it hard for me to want to kiss him, though I do try to ignore it and I do kiss him.   
   
I have brought it up to him to brush his teeth twice before and he gets angry and tells me he's aware his teeth are gross but he doesn't have time to go to a dentist because of work ( I know and I'm sure he knows this is an excuse). When I mention that brushing his teeth can at least prevent things from getting worse, he will then transition the discussion into an argument about other things. I'm more than sure this stems from his childhood growing up in an aggressive household that would really beat his confidence about anything he did wrong. This makes sense too because the only time I do notice he brushes his teeth is when we are going to his parents house for the day.   
   
I know this isn't something to break up over and I really want to help him with this. I know I can't just straight up tell him to brush his teeth, but there has to be other more subtle or passive ways to get him to start doing it. I brush my teeth daily with an electric timed toothbrush and I do try to make it obvious that I'm brushing my teeth as like a 'hint hint', but sadly it doesn't work.   
   
Please, any advice from men would be extremely appreciated!! I dont want to see my boyfriends teeth fall out, which I'm afraid might be what he will have to go through to realize he needs to brush his teeth.   
   
   
TLDR; My 24 year old boyfriend, who I live with alone, doesn't brush his teeth and will cause an argument if i try to tell him to brush his teeth. Only time he will brush his teeth is when we go to his parents house. Any advice to subtly or passively get him to brush his teeth would be appreciated!!!",0

I'm an 18 year old with a blind and severely lazy left eye. I've had it since I was about 7ish but it's gotten progressively worse as time has gone on to the point where it's impossible to miss nowadays. On top of this, the iris color changed from blue to green and I developed a cataract over the pupil. Just my luck.

Since it's gotten severe (about 4 years or so I think) my confidence has gone down the shitter. I avoid eye contact because I hate people noticing it (even though I know they will anyway) and I dread anyone mentioning it to me. There are days where I feel so low and just wanna scoop it out and get it over with.

There hasn't been a single day where I haven't looked in the mirror and just hated myself. I always think about stupid things like how I'll be alone forever because no girl would wanna date a guy with a lazy, discolored eye who can't even look at her right.

To try and build any semblance of self confidence I can, I've worked out and bought sunglasses to cover it up. I've sunk a lot of time into making a large social group so I feel better about myself but nothing really works.

I feel so uncomfortable talking to anyone about how I feel about it. Even my best friend, my brother, and my parents just think that I'm fine with it. I'm a ""bottle-it-up"" kind of guy and don't really express my emotions in that way. This is by far my biggest physical insecurity and it just eats me up.

I do want kids, I’ve always wanted kids. She’s sprung this on me now because she can still claim the statutory maternity leave pay whereas her employer’s maternity pay will be non-existent in her new role until a few years have passed.

I always said I wanted to try for a baby at 30. It seems like a good age and my kids will have grown up to be in their late 20s when we’re around late 50s / early 60s. I just don’t know if now is the right time. Is there a right time? Can I afford it? Who the hell looks after the child if my fiancée and me are at work?

What are the two best pieces of equipment you can get for a home gym with limited space? Limited to two pieces of equipment/machines. Recommendations?,4,htxq1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/htxq1m/what_are_the_two_best_pieces_of_equipment_you_can/,14,1595179096.0,"I cannot even begin to describe how great my life was going when I was hitting the gym (mind you, I was only at it for a few months at the time, before corona-virus put an end to it). It's one of those things that falls within the cliché saying of ""you don't know what you have until it's gone"".

I live in a small townhouse with very limited room - I've convinced my parents to let me get some workout equipment, which is limited to one machine and then another being some sort of weight set

I've come to the decision of a barbell/curl bar weight set and a pull-up bar/dip stand, both of which I linked below and my reasoning for each

Both of these were the first things I got comfortable with and enjoyed using. I feel like they are both pretty versatile in terms of all the different types of workouts you can do with them and muscle groups you can hit but I'd love some feedback and whether there are better choices of equipment. My budget is no more than $300 and 2 piece of equipment - one small and one big(ger).

1. [Barbell/curl bar weight set](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IX63PKO/ref=crt_ewc_title_dp_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A3AN9QJNQ0FYAY): *Reasoning ->* Versatile. Mind you, I'm not going to have an actual bench so my workout choices will *still* be somewhat limited. I can do good upper body/bicep workouts with these as well as lower body stuff, like quad/leg workouts, squats, etc. maybe even some sort of modified dead lift? I'm not too keen on lower body workouts besides using the machines at the gym, so I apologize if I'm using the term ""dead lift"" or anything else incorrectly. I'm sure there are much more workouts you can do with something like this, besides your usual bicep curl.
2. [Pull-up bar/dip stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZR6NDWQ/ref=crt_ewc_title_dp_2?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=AUK1LBRRMNKYN): *Reasoning ->* Great piece of equipment that can work on upper body - dips, pull-ups, etc.. I can work out legs and core/abs as well. I feel like this machine is also very versatile in terms of the different workouts you can do with it and different muscle groups you can hit (upper body, core, legs).

What do you guys think about these 2 pieces of equipment? Any recommendations to swap out for different equipment? If you were limited to 2 piece of equipment, what would your choices be?

I'm mainly just trying to stay fit and put on some muscle (with a slight focus more on upper body). I'm not overweight or out of shape ( 5'4"", 135 lbs.) and do get plenty of cardio.

***TL;DR -*** With room for only 2 piece of equipment, how will this [curl bar](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IX63PKO/ref=crt_ewc_title_dp_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A3AN9QJNQ0FYAY) and [dip station](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZR6NDWQ/ref=crt_ewc_title_dp_2?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=AUK1LBRRMNKYN) suffice in terms of maximizing my workout efficiency with limited space. Are there other machines I should look into in terms of more versatility and different workout/muscle groups?",0

One in particular is going through a rough time. We go back nearly a decade, half way through school. His mother is planning a big career change, and with that, an address change. He's not being kicked out, however, he knows/thinks he won't enjoy the living arrangement his mum has planned for in two years time. On top of that, he wants to produce music and live easy, but is coming to the realisation that's not possible to do with a low-paying job. Doubly-so as he wants to eventually purchase a house of his own.

He was my waiter and I gave him my contact info in a gesture of kindness (he was shaking really bad etc) I understand in hindsight it may seem like i was coming on to him, but i really just wanna befriend him since im trying to expand my friend group.**





Ive lived in this area for a while without a car for a few years so i really want to work on my social circle now that I finally got a one. Ive made only female freinds so far, but I met a guy while he was waiting my table when i was with some other people. He was shaking really bad, so i asked if he was okay and he explained he was under alot of pressure because several groups came in at the same time. At the end, I left him a thank note with my contact info in it. We all left him a tip because we felt sorry for him + he did a great job but now i see it may have seemed like just me lmao. Anyhow.... I just wanna get to know him. Im a people person and people always say to make friends you need to put yourself out there but the truth is it feels like outgoing, friendly people are seen as obnoxious and weird or something these days lol. And its even more complicated befriending men directly than in a friend group! I have no friend group to bounce off of here and no activities to meet other adults (very small town...) 


Since i know how it can seem when you give someone your contact info, ive said several times  indirectly so far how im glad to meet someone to hang out with, havent flirted, had normal but succinct convos and said id talk to him later to give him space. I come back a few days later so he can breathe lol. I'm really trying to not come off as being interested in THAT sort of way. As time passes ill be more and more direct that i want to be friends, because im not about to just say ""okay so first things first, i dont wanna date you, stop talking to me if you want to date me"" within a week of knowing this dude because thats very awkward at the least and terribly conceited at the worst. 


He asked if i wanted to hang out literally two days later, but i literally couldn't that day and offered another time im available and he seemed cool about it. We agreed to meet in a week, i know group settings are the best but at least for the first meeting i guess itll be just us.

When I was a child, I wished (still do, actually) I'd had a brother instead of sisters so we could do guy stuff together; I believe that would've made me much happier.

One, I am genuinely curious. Two, to tell my story.

In November of 2018, my 14 yr old sister had double vision for about a month or so and we went to a regular eye doctor and she said she had 20/20 vision. We decided to get it checked out again, so she went to the pediatrician, who referred her to an MRI that same night. They saw the results and sent her to UM in Ann Arbor for another MRI that night. We figured out that she had an inoperable tumor in her brain stem. Somehow, we got into a clinical trial, one of only twelve kids with the same rare disease, called DIPG and the same cancer that Lloyd Carr’s grandson had. From there the doctors said she would be alive for 9-12 months. That was 19 months ago,and through two rounds of radiation and constant drugs through UM’s outstanding work we’ve been able to steal some time back. Per her last MRI and how it’s progressing, the prognosis from here is only a couple of months, mostly in a wheelchair.
 
Right after her diagnosis, I found Swimming by Mac Miller. It was the first music I had really heard from him, and I listened to that album whenever I would be thinking about it. It was a way for me to collect my thoughts, to store them. Going through what we went through would’ve been impossible without Mac. RIP",0

My (21F)  ex (24M) received nudes from me during our relationship (on iMessage too, his reasoning was that he wanted to look at them often and more than once... yeah I know, it was a very toxic relationship and I’m fortunate to have gotten out without being used for sex or before anything drastic could happen). We lived 50km apart (we are both in Ontario if this info matters for legal purposes) and we couldn’t see each other often, so i gave into his requests. We had a lot of arguments about his suspicious behaviour and during the middle, I all of a sudden noticed all the red flags: gaslighting, control, manipulation, lying, pressuring etc. We had planned to meet up and i cancelled on him two days before because i was unhappy with the way he’d been acting and his refusal to get tested for stds. He got extremely angry and said i didn’t trust him and that he didn’t want to get tested during corona. I told him it was fine he felt that way and we could wait until after he got tested and he still was very angry and said “just fucking do it, if you want to be with me then just see me and go with the flow.” This was the first time i saw such an entitled, angry, selfish and abusive side of him, and i quickly started to lose feelings. I tried to end it a few days after but didn’t have the courage to follow through and backtracked. We did end things eventually because it became very toxic. We did not end on good terms. I am very thankful i turned him down for sex and we never did sleep together ultimately (it would have been my first time too). He also likes to have raw sex and when he said he wouldn’t get tested, i asked him to wear a condom and he said he didn’t want sex with a condom. Im really glad he showed me all these red flags early even after telling me he loves and cares about me and wants to give me “whatever my heart desires.” When he had that outburst and it all clicked for me, i realized that he likely has covert narcissistic personality disorder. He literally has every symptom outlined in the Dsm. He messaged me three weeks after our breakup and i ignored it. I didnt know what to say to him and was afraid of how he would respond. Now, keep in mind that although i acknowledge i made a mistake in sending him nudes, i was at least somewhat smart enough in NEVER putting my face in them. There also weren’t any recognizable things in the background, i don’t have any tattoos or anything that would distinguish me. I’m really worried that he will post revenge porn of me or create a fake nude with my face attached. He thankfully doesn’t have my parents’ contacts and he doesn’t know anyone in my life as far as i know. He is a very vindictive person and will likely hold a grudge for a while. Have you as a man found that guys share nudes they get with their friends or to porn websites? Does this happen a lot? Is there anyway to find out if he did or didn’t? He even could have posted them to reddit... *facepalm.* I’m just scared now and feel helpless. Any advice would be appreciated.",0

I am a fairly new husband (married a little over a year) and I feel like I’m starting to fail my wife. I have had some pretty bad mental health issues throughout my life. I had a physically and mentally abusive father who I no longer have a relationship with. Every “father figure” in my life has been a major disappointment or is no longer around. My parents, grandparents, and in-law’s relationships have all ended in divorce. Going into my relationship and marriage, I have been scared shitless that it would turn out the same or that I would have no concept of what a successful relationship would be like. It has always been on the back of my mind and is a fairly common cause of stress. 

Our first 8 months of marriage were great as was our relationship before that. We’ve had plenty of struggles and hardships and worked through them together. Absolutely no major issues whatsoever for 8 years of our relationship (5 years long distance). Then things came to a crashing halt last October. We lost a lot of money trying to purchase a house that fell through. Shortly after that my MIL moved in with us because she’s divorcing her abusive husband (been living with us since March). Then Coronavirus happened and we’ve all been stuck in our small apartment together working from home. It’s been one thing after another. We are preparing to try to buy a house again now and are talking about trying to get pregnant next year. That coupled with other life issues and stressors makes it feel like my stress/pressure is getting towards a breaking point. 

Lately I’ve been unable to handle my stress well. I burst out with anger sometimes and other times completely retreat and can hardly function. I’m beginning to feel like I’m backtracking in my mental health and that I’m not fit to become a parent or to be a supportive husband. I know my wife is having a really hard time with everything as well, and I feel like I’m completely failing at being there for her. I understand that I have mental health issues that should be addressed, but I’m reluctant to talk about it. I don’t want to bring up my insecurities to my wife and give her more reason to worry. I also don’t have many guy friends that I would feel comfortable talking to about it. 

Any advice you can provide would be appreciated. I’m trying to not overreact and take things one day at a time. I’m considering professional help and I’m open to the idea of taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medicine as necessary. But, how do I work on getting past these feelings of being an inadequate husband and worrying I will be an inadequate father one day? I want to be there for my wife and family and I really struggle to do that some days. What steps should I be taking to set my future self up for success and foster a better relationship?

I have tried everything to stop the fight, and he called me a coward for it, so I invited him to meet me BEFORE that vacation so we can talk/fight without ruining the night... but the pussy ignored me because his friends dont live on the same town as us and he doesnt want to feel alone and shit (he basically just wants to fight me when surrounded by is friends)

So I basically told him: “you are insignificant to me, I dont give a shit abt you and if you are a real man and really hate me that much you should just meet me tomorrow at xxx, but I know you are too coward for that. I am not going after you or waste my night with you, but if you still want to fight just come at me, but Im not gonna waste my time meeting with you and shit, I DONT WANNA FIGHT YOU, but you know where I will be and Im not gonna hide, if you come to fight me I will fight you”

For a little context, I was hired first and he was brought on as my teammate because his program ran out of work, while I had too much on my plate and while I wasn't really asked to show him how to do what we do, I became an unintentional teacher. It isn't an experience difference. In fact we're both entry level for this work but we're still paid deferentially.

So I come from a relatively well off family, nothing crazy, but basically growing up we could afford the 'finer things in life'.

I have immigrated to Canada for a few years now, and I've lived in many countries before that.

As a university student, I currently find it so lonely here. I cannot meet women who are of let's say a similar socio-economic class or similar upbringing. Where I grew up, I find that many people who are from an ""Upper Class"" background to be materialistic, and that most non-materialistic people are from the upper class as well. However, growing up, money was never discussed throughout elementary and even high school. Most people were comfortable.

In Toronto, many women that I meet are either really materialistic or don't share the same values etc due to different cultural background and even economic background. Loud, gaudy, flashy, entitled. Most of them treat me differently when they see my car, or know where I live etc. So I am stuck either meeting women that want me to buy them things because that is what they are used to, or women who treat me differently expecting things in return and don't really show their true personality.

Basically what I am asking is, at 22, how do I find women who come from a wealthy background, but aren't materialistic?",0
How do you deal with fear and feeling inadequate?,5,ht3a0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/ht3a0g/how_do_you_deal_with_fear_and_feeling_inadequate/,22,1595046614.0,"This turned out to be a vent. TL;DR at the bottom.

I was at work (race track) today and the cashier came up to me and said there are four scary guys in the lobby that are probably drunk. I said I will deal with them. When I went to the lobby to get a drink and saw them my hands literally started shaking and I had to hold the  cup with both hands so they won't see it.

I went back to my booth and they started to get ready to drive. I told them they look intoxicated so I can't let them on the track. Two of them came up to the booth and one of them said that ""I'm not intoxicated, I just have a leg brace"". When he pulled his trouser leg up he indeed had a brace with what I assume was a knife handle poking out. I said I'm letting the drivers up next to the track and we'll settle this after that. 

I let the drivers up next to the track and went to talk to the intoxicated crew. They were pressing me really hard about going driving and trying to manipulate me (we're not intoxicated, it would've been a nice friday activity, are you saying you're serious, how can we drive out of here if we're intoxicated). I just dismissed all their comments and responded to everything something along the lines of ""I don't care what do you want to do or what you will do, but you won't be driving on this track today"". In my mind I was thinking that if I let them see I'm even a tiny bit afraid they will shank me then and there. They went away after a small argument and after that one of them came to the booth saying I'm racist and if I won't let them drive my work day will end in an ambulance. I didn't even know how to respond so I just looked him straight in the eyes until he left.

In the end they went to the lobby, harassed our cashier (nothing out of ordinary for drunk customers), ordered some shots and went on their way. After they left I went to the cashier to ask how did she deal with them and to aknowledge the situation and debrief what just happened.

I just continued my job as usual but after I quit for the day I just can't help but feel ashamed and guilty for experiencing fear. I know it's normal but somehow I just feel that when our cashier asked me for help and I was put on the spot that I wasn't strong or intimidating enough because I feared. This might sound like a cliche but it made me feel like less of a man.

I want to know how other men of reddit deal with fear and feeling inadequate because of it. I dealt with the situation as best as I could but somehow I just can't get past it. I really can't think of anything else but how I think I should've acted.

TL;DR: I had an intimidating situation at work today and I got really scared. I'm having feelings of inadequacy and disappointment because I got scared. How do you deal with these feelings?",0

I've\[M/24\] been going to therapy this recent weeks and surely helped to make this quarantine a bit better and not drive myself crazy on my thoughts. It helped really with my anxiety and some negative thoughts that i did have and i'm dealing with it one day at time.

In general i feel a bit better but i noticed something during this past weeks and it's that i usually try to act ""nice"" and i noticed when talking with my friends, coworkers or people in general that i interact from day to day. 

Usually i notice this because i often overthink what to say, worry if what i said was the correct thing on the moment even to the point when texting i just edit the message or delete it. Even saying no or speaking/standing up for myself seems a bit difficult due to this, as i said in the title i just try to avoid any conflict with someone just so i don't appear to be ""rude"" or that people reject me because i said something bad to them. In the past during high school i dealt with a similar issue that i was a bit of a people pleaser and wanted to be ""cool"" with everyone but more later i realized that it's not like that in reality.

Honestly i'm tired of that mindset and i feel it's something that it's dragging me down on being genuinely myself or even connecting with my friends or other people and i would like to work on that to be better. Any advice on how to work on this issue or if anyone had this same issue in the past how did you go through change that and be more yourself?

The biggest one for me was sex drive. We are pretty much told constantly that sex is all men think about so when my SO didn't jump me every five seconds I assumed it was because of me. Come to find out I just have a way higher sex drive than him. This also led to the fun realization that men really like it when you initiate. Another thing I just assumed they didn't like because I just assumed men wanted to be in charge. Needless to say, it hasn't been a problem since I got used to the idea I could jump him.

"What are your experiences with being “cum shamed” by a sexual partner or SO? (As in, they act grossed out by your orgasm to the point where you can’t even enjoy it anymore)",299,hsfdwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/hsfdwi/what_are_your_experiences_with_being_cum_shamed/,145,1594953379.0,"This is rarely talked about, but I’ve had this occur on multiple occasions in my life with different partners, including my current partner. Where they act so completely repulsed or even afraid of semen that I feel bad for even orgasming in the first place. If it gets even close to them they’ll pull faces, or hide themselves, or freak out, or immediately run into the bathroom before I’ve even come down from that 30 second “high”. 

I’m not talking about willingness to swallow or take a full facial or anything fetishized. Just the typical stuff that comes with normal sexual acts. 

With my current SO, at first during non intercourse sex she would put a towel on the floor next to the bed, and make me finish onto that so it didn’t get close to her. If any did get on her stomach or whatever, she would immediately pull a really grossed out face, and yell to get a tissue. She’d actually pull this winced face of fear as soon as I said I was ready to finish...and sort of hide / aim me away. 

After many talks explaining to her how this made me feel disgusting, ashamed, and disconnected with her...she eventually got a lot better with it. But still not perfect. And some past partners were a lot worse. 

For me these experiences really ruin the sexual connection with the partner, and also makes me feel ashamed of a normal bodily function. It also ruins the orgasm since I’m so tense and focused on not getting it in the wrong place. 

It feels like a serious double standard never talked about. If any guy were to act grossed out, or freak out when a female partner gets too wet or any fluids on them during sex...they’d be called assholes. But for some reason it seems to have been normalized that it’s perfectly acceptable to make guys feel like their jizz is radioactive.

Everyone has the right to not want to get covered in sexual fluids. And nobody can help if they feel grossed out by it. But I think there’s some pervasive mentality that semen is inherently nasty, which I expect makes these phobias worse. I don’t think people are ever really taught “semen is harmless. It’s mostly water. It’s totally normal. It’s even good for your skin. There’s no reason to be grossed out by it with a consenting partner. If you’re willing to have sex with someone, you need to be prepared for the fluids that come with that.”

What do I do about my on and off again relationship?,4,hsd91j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/hsd91j/what_do_i_do_about_my_on_and_off_again/,7,1594947190.0,"Hello everyone, thanks for whomever takes the time to read this.

I  assume this is perhaps a common issue on this subreddit, but I'm hoping  someone out there has some good advice about a relationship I've had on  and off with my currently ex gf for about 4-5 years.

The  relationship started off from the get go being quite confusing and  difficult. It was always the case that she was very unsure about our  relationship which resulted in us breaking up about 3 times within the  1st year. I know, from that fact alone it would be enough to simply tell  me to move on, which I am actually trying to do, but hear me out.

To  try and summarize 4 years into a few sentences is quite difficult, so  I'll try and mention the important points. As I mentioned the first year  was very rocky, she still had feelings for an ex-boyfriend. She was  also dealing with a shitty home-life at the time, which made it harder  for her to move on with somebody new, since her ex was already familiar  with all that she'd been going through. So I was caught in a weird  triangle. Every time she'd break up with me she'd mention different  reasons, such as there being a wall between us, or that she wasn't  emotionally ready to be with somebody else or that she couldn't see any  longevity between us.

She later  mentioned that all these reasons were due to the fact that her  ex-boyfriend was somebody she depended on and always turned to whenever  things in her life got tough - It seemed to be her norm.

Fast  forward a few month/years, we were still quite on an off, she'd break  up with me for so many reasons that I've honestly forgotten about half  of them. There were many instances were I felt like I was treated like  shit (aside from the constant break ups), such as ignoring me at public  events (with friends around), giving me the cold shoulder and generally  having quite passive aggressive behavior towards me, sometimes expecting  me to understand why she was acting the way she was without telling me  upfront what I was doing wrong. Here in lies the dilemma in why I kept  fixing things and starting things again with her - In my mind at the  time I thought that because of all the shit she was going through, it  excused her bad behavior towards me and I'd ignore it just so I could be  there for her, and that this was just a phase that would pass.

This  cycle repeated for a while, when eventually we got back together and  this time it seemed like we were actually taking things seriously.  Throughout the year we went through crappy times however it didn't  result in a break-up like it previously did. Our cycle is generally that  the first few months are great, we're both really into each other and  enjoy spending time together. Eventually that starts to fade - I  personally think it's more on her side that she starts drifting off and  seems less and less interested in me, she becomes snappy, gets easily  frustrated at me for what I think to be massive over reactions, and  generally takes me for granted.

I  get that this is obviously a biased view of our relationship, but just  to give you an example of what I mean - One time i took a day off from  work to be able to take her to an apartment viewing since she needed to  find a new place. Instead of being appreciative that I took a day off  from work, she was pissed off and angry at me for misunderstanding where  to pick her up from (which I apologized for), and just gave me the  silent treatment the entire trip (I was only 5 minutes late).

For  the first time in our 4-5 years I couldn't take anymore of the  snappiness, I felt on edge around her, I felt like I everything I did  was wrong and so I ended it. She agreed that things weren't working out  so it was a mutual decision. This was about 2 years ago.

In  these 2 years we've hooked up a couple of times, whenever we see each  other in public we always end up spending most of the night talking.  We've both seen other people in these 2 years. She has approached me  wanting to start things up again more than once (even when seeing  someone else). It's been very difficult for me to say no, I've spent 4-5  years getting back with her but I'm at that point (most would say about  fucking time) that I can't see us ever working out. I still have strong  feelings for her. I've mentioned lots of negative things about her so  It's easy to wonder what the hell i see in her, but she's also a very  intelligent, beautiful, hard working and driven woman which I admire.

2  months ago we met each-other by accident while walking our dogs. Again  we spent a few hours together walking the dogs just like we used to, it  felt good. After the walk she messaged me asking if we could meet up  again. I explained that I wasn't ready for that yet. She clarified that  she meant that she wants to work things out, that she wants us to work  on each other. The thing is that I've heard this before, every time she  wanted us to get back, she'd say similar things, and every time I wanted  so desperately to believe it that I'd give it another shot, but I'm at a  point that as much as I think i miss her, there doesn't seem like  there's a happy ending to this story.

I  feel that like her ex-boyfriend before me, she could be using me as an  emotional tool, when things get rough in her life, she needs somebody  familiar with her story and her situation and I've become that guy. She  did mention that something came up and that she'd talk to me about it if  we get back together, but she doesn't want to burden me if we aren't in  a relationship.

I'm just  confused, as cliche as it sounds my heart wants to get back with her and  my mind is saying stay away and try and move on.

Thanks for reading, any advice would be greatly appreciated :)",0

I feel like this makes it worse because while I’m being fucking terrified to talk to women, I think they just assume I’m not interested since I’m not putting the moves on or whatever.

And I never really realized that even though I've always wanted a family. I guess I imagined it being more 50/50 work raising them but it also isn't super realistic. 

Also, I know there is a lot of stigma with it too. While I personally do not care much, I don't know if it will be difficult for the potentially future kids. What are ways to handle or avoid issues with it? While where I'm at now is amazing, I've previously had cops called on me for walking my dogs at the park without a kid with me.

I was thinking about this today and realised that whenever I would meet with friends or want to go out I can pretty much guarantee I'd be the only person wearing a shirt and that 99% of people would be in jeans, trainers and a t-shirt. When going out to casual places like cheap chain restaurants I understand it but if I'm going somewhere a bit nicer I'd like to dress a bit better. I've tried suggesting places to go to dress a bit nicer but I get shot down at the idea. 


I know it's probably to do with the people I'm friends with but I'm not sure how to bring it up with them or suggest we go somewhere that might have a dress code *SHOCK HORROR*.

How do I deal with my town’s obnoxious retirees and their loud golf carts?

This was originally to facilitate travel during the MANY festivals we host during the summer months as it alleviates strain on our parking areas, particularly for tourists. The same town has an incredibly large demographic of retired individuals who see the area as a vacation home. These are the individuals who own the golf carts. Lately, they collectively have taken to the hobby of doing drive by “honkings”, where they speed passed their friends house and smash the horn as many times as they can in a matter of seconds before speeding off down the road to their next victim. These do this through out the day, seemingly on a schedule. Most of the time their victims aren’t even home. These aren’t “beeps” but rather full blown car horns. 

Due to the pandemic, I’ve been using my newly found spare time to restore the exterior of my victorian house which has necessitated my spending a lot of time on ladders. Yesterday they committed a drive by honking while I was on a ladder on my porch installing a new light and it scared the shit out of me and I almost fell. The day before they did it while I was gardening. Today they did it while I was installing bead board. This has been going on for at least a week.

It is worth mentioning that my front door is 20 ft from the street. 

I’ve asked them to stop honking but they won’t. I’ve filed a noise complaint but the police choose not to enforce the noise ordinances on old people. Their friends (my neighbors) think the honking game is funny as they participate in it too.

I have no idea how to handle this situation.",0

Not trying to shame anyone or anything but I’m genuinely curious -why is it that the girls with that look get way more male attention than girls who prefer to look more natural? Thanks in advance for your replies!",0

She was graduating but I’m still stuck here in grad school for awhile to come. I met her through a mutual friendship by total coincidence and during those few weeks, especially within the last few days she was here, everything seemed to just click in a way that felt too good to be true. But it was never something we ever directly talked about, just a bunch of small spur of the moment type stuff up until she left. I knew that it’d be a bad idea to let myself get attached since she was leaving and there was nothing I could do about it—but emotions got the best of me and I completely fell for her anyways. 

But we still talk—a lot. Every single day since she’s left we text back and forth a ton and have ended every night since wishing each other a goodnight.

We spent every day we could together, and it was fun a great. I would come home from college every weekend to be with her, which I wanted, at first. I slowly started to notice that I didn’t really feel like I belonged in college. I didn’t have a friend group like my brother who I could chill with or go to bars or play games with. I didn’t do things for myself and stopped my hobbies and even stopped watching movies by myself. 

So I said okay, I don’t want to hang out this weekend. I would say I want some me time. And every time I did this I was pretty much met with “I don’t feel like a priority” or “I don’t feel loved.”

And those are valid opinions, I mean a lot of relationships will die if there’s one sided attention and desire to do things. But how do you express that you’re feeling unbalanced, while also making them feel assured that you’re not leaving them behind. How do you ask for me-time without making someone feel like they’re annoying or that you don’t want to hang out with them? How do you make your relationship more so a complement to your life than the whole of it, without making your partner feel unloved or rejected?

Just a quick question here. Last night I was hanging out with friends and one of the girls said that she didn’t talk to her bf for the whole quarantine (it lasted 2 months and a half where I live) because she wanted him to think and remember her value and come back to her before she breaks up for good. She said it was kind of like a « test ». Knowing her bf I was kind of surprised he came back. He is kind of cocky and he loves to show off and think of himself like he is the best human walking on earth.

So my question is : when you guys don’t talk to the girl your love for a significant amount of time, do you usually go back to her or it doesn’t do anything to you and just move on ? 🤔

Guys who have been hurt before. How do we help build trust? Advice please,4,hqqq5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/hqqq5o/guys_who_have_been_hurt_before_how_do_we_help/,11,1594713082.0,"TL;DR at the bottom! 

I (28F) met a guy (30M) back in December online (I know, yikes!) 
Right from the start, we'd opened up to each other about our past relationships and specifically wanted to avoid the head fuck and heartache we'd both suffered before with any future potential partner. 

We've spent the last 8 months online gaming together, drinking, bonding.. All that fun stuff and we both fell for each other as hard as you can without meeting each other. 

However, here's my issue. Everytime he feels like he is getting closer to me or that I'm getting too close, he pulls away from me and it's obvious (he's since admitted it). He assures me it's to protect himself because I quote ""he won't let anyone in his walls again"". 

Things took a turn last month though, I had a pretty toxic situation with an ex house mate of mine (they've very recently moved out) so as my friend, the guy in question offered me refuge in his home whilst the house mate moved out. I asked him several times before I came that he had to be sure because once I'm there, I'm there. 

I've been here roughly 3 weeks now. The first night I arrived he was drunk, like really drunk due to nerves of meeting me but we settled quickly and everything happened so naturally. Nothing happened apart from a lot of flirting, cuddles in bed watching TV and a lot of laughter. Exactly how I expected it to be. However, the next morning he couldn't leave the bed quick enough and pretty much avoided me for the next 2 days until I forced him to talk to me. He had told me he thought he'd be okay with me being there but the reality of it just makes him more aware of how not ready he is to even entertain a relationship right now. I of course was hurt by this but I accepted it because it's him and he's a human with feelings too. We then spent the next few days just getting used to being friends in the same house. 

Fast forward a few more days, we get drunk again and once more, he's play fighting with me, trying to hold me and acting extremely flirtatious but this time I told him to stop. I asked him why he does this with me when he's had a drink but is so distant from me when he's sober and that I felt like he's led me on. He didn't agree nor like my statement and we ended up having a little fight. 

A few days later, we've established a new dynamic of us just being friends and as of right now, I'm fairly certain I'm just being friend zoned even though he still assures me that he isn't and he does like me. 

My question is beneath all of this is what do I do? Do I accept we're never going to be anymore and keep insisting the flirting stops to protect myself or is there more to this and should I be patient and wait for him to see I'm genuinely not going to hurt him and build trust? 

I've never experienced anything like this before and I need to know if I should just let it go. 

Sorry for the long post and I really appreciate any advice you all have! 

TL;DR - I met a boy online, we fell for each other but when we met in person it became obvious he wasn't ready for a relationship and I feel a little led on. Do I wait for him or accept it's not a thing?",0
"[Serious] Men in happy long term relationships (at least 7 years), what role did sexual attraction play when you initially met?",4,hqqnld,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/hqqnld/serious_men_in_happy_long_term_relationships_at/,15,1594712820.0,"Hey guys,

I am a 35 year old man, kinda fed up with all the dating crap. I'm looking to settle down in the next five years and I want to pick a good partner with my main criteria her being a team player, trained and willing to practice non-violent communication. And compatible drive for physical contact, not only sex, but all the good stuff. Cuddling and kissing and all that jazz.

So I have a few questions for men who have managed to find a partner with whom that works for a long phase.

Was there intense sexual attraction im the beginning or did it build up over a long time with the emotional connection? Do you also have a little more 'porn like' sex from time to time or is it exclusively the loving stuff? The start times? Are there women who are extremely closed off and shy with sex initially, but absolutely have their own drive and initiative once committed? Is it worth waiting for someone to warm up over months? Or is that always a trap? How did you spot the difference? What do you do to keep a healthy dynamic alive? What is your stance on compromises and male 'leadership' in your relationship?

I would love to read your experiences and opinions!",0

focused on women and their experiences and opinions.  Thersdays will run from 12am ET Thursday to 12am ET Friday.

 Examples of things we'll remove:

* What do you think of men who x?

* How does it make you feel when men x?

* What are your best/worst experiences with men?

* If a man does x, how would you react?

If you have any questions about these supplemental rules, please message the moderators and we will be happy to discuss it with you.

Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

"Women who have had bad anxiety about eating in front of others (especially in front of men), how did you overcome it?",2567,hkta7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/hkta7n/women_who_have_had_bad_anxiety_about_eating_in/,343,1593847733.0,"Edit: Wow. I did NOT expect this thread to blow up as much as it did. Like many of you, I didn't realize how many others had issues with this. This is one of the many reasons I love this sub-Reddit.
