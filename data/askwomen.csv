Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.
